# CheatSheets
Notes from learning platform


For every chapter starting at Django I will be adding all of the commands or functions in the chapter to text files and making 
or finding tables of them to use as a reference. I'll also summarize pages for ones I think I need a better understanding of so I can go
over it. This is entirely for me and if you don't like it deal with it. :)
